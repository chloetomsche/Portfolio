            <h3>General info about me</h3>

            <div class="contentnimg1">
                <p>I am currently a senior at the University of Minnesota, majoring in Strategic Communications. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep passion for digital design and using my creativity to bring fun and engaging projects to life. This love for creative expression is what originally drew me to my major, as I wanted to explore the intersection of advertising and design, crafting visually compelling messages that could engage audiences in meaningful ways. However, as time went on, I discovered another area of interest that I hadn’t previously considered—web design and web development. This newfound passion emerged when I enrolled in a Media Design class, where we were given the opportunity to code our own websites. I found myself excited by the entire process. From brainstorming the aesthetic and conceptual aspects of the site to actually implementing my vision through coding. It was a perfect blend of logic and creativity, and it excited me in ways I hadn’t expected.

            <h3 class="h3-flipped">What am I doing with my life?</h3>

            <div class="contentnimg2">
                <p>Before taking that class, I had always viewed design as something purely visual, where success was measured by how aesthetically pleasing an image or layout appeared. But through coding, I realized that design isn’t just about visuals; it’s about functionality, user experience, and interactivity. This piqued my curiosity and motivated me to dive deeper into programming, eager to learn how to make my websites not only look great but also function seamlessly. As I explored further, I found myself wanting to understand the mechanics behind web interactivity rather than simply focusing on the surface-level design. This shift in interest led me to consider a potential career in front-end web development which was something that never would have crossed my mind in the early years of my college experience.  When I first started university, I had no clear idea of what I wanted to pursue. Like many students, I felt lost, unsure of which path would be the right one for me. I had a very fixed and limited mindset about my own capabilities, believing that I could only excel in areas that came naturally to me. The thought of me ever working as a front-end web developer seemed completely out of reach, simply because I had convinced myself that I wasn’t skilled enough or smart enough to learn something as technical as coding. I struggled with constant comparisons to others who seemed more talented, more creative, or simply more experienced in design. This self-doubt was something that held me back for a long time, making me hesitant to branch out and try new things.

        <h3>My childhood limitations</h3>
        <div class="contentnimg3">
            <img src="/css/images/babyme.png" class="img2">

            <p>However, when I reflect on my past, I realize that this self-imposed limitation wasn’t new and that it had followed me since childhood.  Growing up, I had many creative interests, one of which was working with ceramics and polymer clay.  Sculpting small figurines and things out of clay was something that fascinated me, and I would spend hours trying to perfect tiny details.  But like with any new hobby, it took time and practice to improve.  I remember feeling incredibly frustrated when my creations didn’t turn out the way I envisioned.  If something I made didn’t look as polished or detailed as I wanted, I would immediately feel discouraged, thinking that maybe I just wasn’t talented enough. This frustration often made me hesitant to continue, and I had to push myself to keep practicing, even when I felt like giving up.  Over time, as I kept working with clay, I saw clear improvements.  I began to develop a sense of confidence in my abilities, realizing that persistence and patience were the keys to growth.</p>

            <p>However, despite my progress in this one medium, I still hesitated to branch out into other forms of art.  I convinced myself that while I might be good at sculpting, I wasn’t good at drawing, painting, or any other artistic hobby. This closed-off  way of thinking prevented me from exploring new creative avenues, simply because I was afraid of failing.  I boxed myself into a narrow definition of what I was “good” at,  avoiding anything that didn’t immediately come easily to me.  Recently, I decided to challenge this mindset by revisiting my artistic hobbies. I started sculpting again, allowing myself to experiment and create without the pressure of perfection.  As I did this, I began to rekindle my love for artistic expression and started feeling more open to trying other forms of art.  Despite my long-standing belief that I couldn’t draw, I decided to start practicing, focusing on learning basic drawing fundamentals. To my surprise, with just a little bit of practice, I noticed real improvement. It was an eye-opening experience because it directly contradicted the limiting beliefs I had held for so long.   For years, I had told myself that I simply wasn’t good at certain things, but in reality, I had never truly given myself the chance to learn and improve.  This realization made me reflect on other areas of my life where I had let fear of failure hold me back.</p>

            <h3 class="h3-flipped">My career limitations</h3>

            <div class="contentnimg4">
                <p>One of those areas was programming.  Just as I had assumed that I wasn’t “good” at drawing, I had also assumed that I wasn’t “smart” enough to learn how to code.  I saw programming as something extremely technical, reserved for people with a natural aptitude for math and logic—qualities I didn’t think I possessed.  Because of this, I never even considered exploring coding, assuming it was outside of my skill set. However, when I took the Media Design class and had my first experience with coding, something clicked. I realized that coding, much like art, is a skill that can be developed through practice and persistence.  It wasn’t about being naturally gifted, it was more about being willing to learn.  This experience changed everything for me.

            </div>

            <p>Instead of viewing programming as an intimidating, inaccessible skill, I started seeing it as an exciting challenge. I became determined to improve my coding abilities, just as I had done with clay sculpting and drawing. I began enrolling in more design and coding courses, immersing myself in web development and expanding my knowledge of front-end technologies.  With each project, I gained more confidence in my ability to create functional, visually appealing websites. I realized that my initial fears and doubts had been based on false assumptions about my own potential. The more I learned, the more I saw the connections between design and development which both required creativity, problem-solving, and patience.</p>

            <h3>A fixed mindset closes doors</h3>

            <div class="contentnimg5">
                <p>Looking back, I can see how my personal growth has been shaped by breaking down the mental barriers I had imposed on myself.  I used to believe that my abilities were fixed, that I was either naturally good at something or I wasn’t.  But now, I understand that skills are developed through effort and dedication.  This shift in mindset has transformed the way I approach learning, creativity, and challenges in general.  I no longer let the fear of failure stop me from trying new things.  Instead, I embrace the process of learning, knowing that mistakes and setbacks are simply part of the journey.   One of the biggest takeaways from this experience is that stepping out of my comfort zone has been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done.  If I had continued to believe that I wasn’t capable of learning how to code, I never would have discovered my passion for web development.  If I had continued to believe that I wasn’t artistic enough, I never would have picked up drawing again and realized my own potential.  The key to growth is not avoiding challenges, but embracing them with an open mind and a willingness to learn.

            <div class="contentnimg6">
                <p>Now, as I look toward the future, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.  I no longer see limitations but instead I see opportunities. Whether it’s continuing to improve my design and development skills, exploring new artistic mediums, or tackling other challenges that once seemed impossible, I know that I have the ability to grow and adapt.  My journey has taught me that passion and perseverance are more important than innate talent, and that the only real obstacle to success is the fear of trying.  As I prepare to graduate and take the next steps in my career, I carry this newfound confidence with me.  I know that I am capable of learning, evolving, and pushing past my own doubts. No matter what challenges come my way, I am ready to face them with the same determination that has brought me this far.  The journey of self-discovery is ongoing, and I am eager to see where it leads me next.
