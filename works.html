                <p>TinyVet is an app I prototyped in one of my web design classes, using Adobe Photoshop and Figma. We had a free range of what app we wanted to create. I started to do lots of research on the ideas I had but I felt stumped and could not decide what to do. I then started to brainstorm and ask myself, "What could I currently benefit from?", and that's when it hit me. I was looking for exotic pet care for my chinchilla but always had difficulties finding the right vet. That's why I created TinyVet.</p>

                <p>TinyVet is an app for exotic pet owners, such as myself, to have easy and quality access to veterinary care. I noticed that there was a lack of options of care for exotic pets compared to dogs and cats. There’s a strong community between exotic pet owners and I thought this would be a fun opportunity to unite the community in one place, where people also had the access to talk to and book appointments with exotic vets.</p>

                <p>TinyChef is a apple watch apple I prototyped in my UX Design class with Adobe software and Figma. The prompt for this project was to create a app that could be used 10 years in the future. TinyChef is a apple watch app to help beginners who have no experience cooking, to learn how to cook. It took me a while to come up with an idea for this project because it was difficult to think of an idea that was not too futursitic and just not feasible. I started to go back to my own interests and what I liked to do and that's cooking. </p>

            <p>TinyChef is a apple watch app to help beginners who have no experience cooking, to learn how to cook. It's two main features are the scanner feature and the heat detection feature. The scanner feature can scan any produce and it'll show you the best way to cut it. The heat detection feature scans the meat you're cooking and will let you know if it is at safe temperature for consumption.</p>

The infographic shows statistics on verbal abuse, cyberbullying, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and coercion, using icons to represent each type of bullying alongside their corresponding percentages. The design features a soothing blue and gray color scheme, and the flow of the layout visually directs the viewer's attention to each type of bullying, with the central figure of a distressed student symbolizing the victim. At the bottom, I included a call to action encouraging anyone affected by bullying to seek support from organizations like Befrienders International.</p>

                <p>For this project, my group and I created social media posts for Philadelphia Cream Cheese, aiming to target ethnic restaurant owners in major metropolitan cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Houston. The goal was to showcase Philadelphia cream cheese as a versatile, high-quality ingredient that can enhance ethnic dishes and help chefs experiment with fusion cuisine.
                </p>
                <p>The campaign emphasized the tagline "Philly is for Fusion," encouraging restaurant owners to think beyond traditional recipes and incorporate Philadelphia cream cheese into a variety of cultural cuisines. By promoting fusion, we wanted to convey the message that Philadelphia can be used with different flavors and textures, elevating dishes but also maintaining authenticity. The posts aimed to spark creativity in small, open-minded restaurant owners and young chefs, positioning Philadelphia as the ingredient that can enhance both quality and innovation in the food industry.
                </p>
                <p>Using collaborative, fun, and trend-focused language, the posts appealed to restaurant owners who are open to experimenting with new flavors and are focused on providing high-quality dishes for their customers. The campaign aimed to squah the idea that  Philadelphia is not just for bagels, but for any dish that values fusion and innovation.</p>

                <p>My group and I developed a campaign for AMC to address the challenge of competing with streaming services. The goal was to get more people to come to the movies by offering an experience that catered to introverts who enjoy going out but may feel drained by the pressure of social interaction.
                </p>
                <p>To do this, we created the concept of "The Introvert’s Seat"—a unique seat at AMC that offers a separate, personal space for those who want to enjoy the movie without sitting right next to others. The idea behind the seat is to appeal to introverts who might feel obligated to socialize but want their own space to feel comfortable while still enjoying the social atmosphere of the theater.
                </p>
                <p>The ultimate goal was to make AMC feel like a comfortable and inviting space, where people can enjoy movies on their own terms, making it more appealing even with the growing popularity of streaming services like Netflix.</p>
