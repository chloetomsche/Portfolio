            <h3>app prototypes:</h3>
            <h4>TinyVet</h4>
            <p>TinyVet is a app I prototyped in one of my web design classes, using Adobe Photoshop and Figma. We had free range of what app we wanted to create.</p>
            <p>I started to do lots of research on the ideas I had but I felt stumped and could not decide what to do. I then started to brainstorm and ask myself, "What could I currently benefit from?", and that's when it hit me. I was looking for exotic pet care for my chinchilla but always had difficulties finding the right vet.</p>
            <p>That's why I created TinyVet. TinyVet is an app for exotic pet owners, such as myself, to have easy and quality access to veterinary care. I noticed that there was a lack of options of care for exotic pets compared to dogs and cats. Thereâ€™s a strong community between exotic pet owners and I thought this would be a fun opportunity to unite the community in one place, where people also had the access to talk to and book appointments with exotic vets. </p>

            <h4>TinyChef</h4>
            <p>TinyChef is a apple watch apple I prototyped in my UX Design class with Adobe software and Figma. The prompt for this project was to create a app that could be used 10 years in the future.</p>
            <p>It took me a while to come up with an idea for this project because it was difficult to think of an idea that was not too futursitic and just not feasible. I started to go back to my own interests and what I liked to do and that's cooking.</p>
            <p>TinyChef is a apple watch app to help beginners who have no experience cooking, to learn how to cook. It's two main features are the scanner feature and the heat detection feature. The scanner feature can scan any produce and it'll show you the best way to cut it. The heat detection feature scans the meat you're cooking and will let you know if it is at safe temperature for consumption.</p>
